  <h1>Classic Web Browser</h1>

  <p>
    In a world dominated by sleek and modern web browsers, the Classic Web Browser stands as a digital tribute to the golden age of the internet. Designed with simplicity in mind, it brings back the nostalgic feel of early 2000s browsing — a time when the web was more personal, less cluttered, and full of charm. With its retro-inspired interface and straightforward navigation, Classic Web Browser is not just a tool, but a journey through time.
  </p>
  <p>
    Built for users who value speed, minimalism, and that old-school aesthetic, this browser strips away the unnecessary distractions and bloat of modern software. Whether you're visiting your favorite websites, reading archived pages, or simply enjoying the throwback visuals, every click with Classic Web Browser feels like a step into internet history. It’s lightweight, efficient, and completely free to use.
  </p>
  <p>
    Classic Web Browser features a UI styled after Windows 7, bringing a familiar and comfortable environment for users who miss the smooth, rounded design of Microsoft’s most loved operating system. The use of Windows 7-style elements makes it feel right at home on vintage desktops or virtual machines running older OS builds.
  </p>
  <p>
    It’s ideal for vintage computing enthusiasts, retro OS fans, or anyone who wants a break from today’s overwhelming web. It's designed to run smoothly even on older hardware, offering both performance and authenticity. And although it looks retro, it still supports the essential features needed for basic browsing. This makes it perfect for nostalgic sessions or even as a lightweight alternative for basic tasks.
  </p>
  <p>
    However, Classic Web Browser comes with a few limitations to stay true to its old-school spirit. It does not support tabs, meaning you can only view one page at a time — just like in the early days of the web. Additionally, downloading files is currently not supported, which may limit usage for some users who rely on file transfers and media downloads.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you've ever missed the hum of dial-up tones, the charm of early HTML pages, or the feel of gray toolbars and pixelated icons — this browser was made for you. The Classic Web Browser isn’t just software; it’s a tribute to a simpler digital age.
